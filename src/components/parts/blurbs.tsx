        <p>
          Hello World and Welcome to LindsSpace. I know I said I was inspired to get into dev based on seeing interactive museum exhibits (which is true), but once I was in school a little memory came to me, a touch of deja vu. Let me set the stage, I just got home from ballet rehearsals, I hear the instantly recognizable and enthralling sound of a digital door opening, and the bing-bing-bing, upscale chimes start to roll in: it was time to edit my myspace profile. Now, no hate on glitter gifs, but that wasn&apos;t my scene; I was out there flinging around “visibility: hidden” and moving things around. My myspace was my piece de resistance, my personal brand.

          Now with the clarity of the future, I realize I was out there writin&apos; that code even earlier than I realized. This is my homage to my past formative experience and a fun playground for someone with nostalgia for early social networking. Also, being a UX dev, I decided it&apos;d be fun to think how myspace might have looked if it were accessible on mobile. Unfortunately, I have no current plans to add embarrassing emo pictures, but I&apos;m not against it, so shoot me a message if you think that’d be rad addition. x linds
